# Space Rover Game

The **Space Rover Game** is a browser-based experimental platform for studying **human–AI cooperation**, grounded in **threshold public goods game** and **trust game** paradigms. In each round, a human collaborates with an AI teammate to make resource allocation decisions under uncertainty.

This platform was developed for and used in:

**Li, M., & Lee, J. D. (2025).** *Purpose outweighs performance: Trust drops more when AI teammates fail to cooperate, but explanations can repair it.* *International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction.*  
https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2025.2539449

**Rojas, E., Hsu, D., Huang, J., & Li, M. (2025).** *Interpersonal Influence Matters: Trust Contagion and Repair in Human-Human-AI Team.* Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans, 100194. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chbah.2025.100194

The environment is fully configurable, supporting controlled manipulations of **trust violations**, **trust repair strategies**, and **AI behavioral policies**, as well as modifications to payoff structure and game dynamics.

## Key Features

### Human–AI Team Decision-Making
Implements repeated cooperative decisions where outcomes depend jointly on the human player and AI teammate. Supports public-goods–styled payoff structures and dynamic AI strategies.

### Manipulable Trust Violations and Repairs
Researchers can configure:

- **Violation Type**
  - *Performance-based*: AI attempts to cooperate but fails.
  - *Purpose-based*: AI intentionally behaves selfishly.
- **Repair Strategy**
  - Explanation  
  - Apology  
  - Promise  
  - No repair (control)

These manipulations replicate the experimental structure in Li & Lee (2025), and are customizable for new studies.

### Customizable Experimental Variables
Researchers may easily adjust:

1. **Payoff structure**  
2. **AI behavioral policy**  
3. **Number of rounds**  
4. **AI utterances** at the end of each round
